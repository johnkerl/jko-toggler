# jko-toggler

A quick little example of using JavaScript buttons to toggle section visibility for HTML pages.

_Update 2025-01-11:_ This has been reimplemented as (and superseded by) the `URLAndPersistentNButtonToggler` class within the [Sliver JavaScript library](https://github.com/johnkerl/sliver).

Live demo:

* https://johnkerl.org/jko-toggler?all

See [`index.html`](index.html) in this repo for example usage:

* Name the divs you want to be expandable
* Set up a button for each one
* Include [`jko-toggler.js`](jko-toggler.js) at the end of the HTML body
